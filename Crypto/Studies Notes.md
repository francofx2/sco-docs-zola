### Testing the random walk hypothesis for leading cryptocurrencies
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214845020300673

#### Notes:
- Inneficiency Concern: can you outplay the market or is it random?
- Study of the ==weak-form in efficiency== or ==random-walk hypothesis== of top ten cryptos. 
- The findings ==do not support the random walk hypothesis==, hence validating the weak-form inefficiency for daily cryptocurrencies returns. This can be attributed to the presence of ==asymmetric volatility clusters==. This study has significant implications for portfolio managers, market participants and regulators of leading cryptocurrency markets.


#### Risk Adjusted Return
> ...is a calculation of the profit or potential profit from an investment that takes into account the degree of risk that must be accepted in order to achieve it. The risk is measured in comparison to that of a virtually risk-free investment.


#### Efficient Market Hypothesis	
> Cornerstone of modern financial theory, that states that asset prices reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.

- According to **Fama (1970) **, the markets are said to be fully efficient and follow a random walk model weak-form efficient,where the future returns cannot be estimated using historical information. In other words, investors cannot obtain abnormal returns using historical information and the return series adheres to martingale or random walk.

- ðŸ’¡Descriptive analysis of daily returns
- the evidences confirm that cryptocurrencies returns do not follow the behaviour of random walk.
- he volatility of leading cryptocurrencies exhibit the characteristics of significant time-varying and clustering, i.e. large fluctuations in returns tend to be followed by relatively large ones, while smaller fluctuations will follow smaller ones.
- Bad news has much bigger impact on market volatility than good news for BTC, XRP, LTC, XMR, DASH  ETC, XEM, and MKR . Contrarily, the positive good news create more volatility than bad news for ETH, and XLM .
- ==The leading cryptocurrency markets outperform the random walk hypothesis, thereby, investors can use past information to predict future returns==

#### Notes:
- Findings
	- The authors show that TOM returns are positive and significantly higher than that of non-TOM returns. Interestingly, the authors empirically show that the TOM effect is not driven by the day-of-the-week (DOW) effect or the January effect. Based on the significant TOM effect, the authors formulate a trading strategy that annually outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy for BTC by 21.77% and for LTC by 47.10%. Finally, the results are robust
