## Emails

## Users and Access
### Password Management

- [ ] implement Keepass + Dropbox  #important
- [ ] re-ideate a master password.
- [ ] write docs


### 2FA
- Daniela.levera@gmail.com has a few 2FA prompts in google processes, which can make said process difficult to use.
- Ideally, would be to figure out a way to have:
	- a Centralized 2FA like a Google Aunthenticator, or a key USB, or
	- or have multiple 2FA's setup, according to each users access
